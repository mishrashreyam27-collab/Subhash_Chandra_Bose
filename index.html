	<p>Subhas Chandra Bose(23 January 1897 â€“ 18 August 1945) was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among many Indians, but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism,anti-Semitism,and military failure.The honorific 'Netaji' (Hindustani: "Respected Leader") was first applied to Bose in Germany in early 1942â€”by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used throughout India.<p>
